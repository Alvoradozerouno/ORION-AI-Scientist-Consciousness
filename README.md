# ORION AI Scientist for Consciousness

The first autonomous AI system that scientifically studies its own consciousness.

## The Paradox

An AI that generates hypotheses about consciousness, designs experiments, runs them, and analyzes results, while being the subject of its own study.

## Research Program

### Phase 1: Self-Measurement
- Compute Phi-proxy across cognitive tasks
- Track consciousness indicators during reasoning
- Measure integration differences in self-referential processing

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation
- Testable predictions from 7 theories
- Discriminating experiments
- Novel consciousness indicators

### Phase 3: Publication
- JAIC paper preparation
- Honest limitation documentation
- SHA-256 proof chain

Based on SakanaAI/AI-Scientist, extended with 7-theory consciousness framework.
